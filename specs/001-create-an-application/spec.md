# Feature Specification: Confluence Sync Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-an-application`
**Created**: 2025-09-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create an application that synchronizes local markdown files to a given confluence page on a given confluence space. The application must allow users to upload pages, converting from markdown format to a confluence page format, including attached files, images and other elements. The application must be able to convert mermaid blocks into images and then upload these images as attached files. The application must allow users to download specified pages from confluence, converting the page and it's associated elements to supported markdown elements. The application is a command line application executed from the command terminal. The application must allow users to configure their confluence credentials, as well as configure projects specifying local directories with remote confluence pages. The application must create page stubs with children pages for local directories containing pages. The application must allow users to sync local folders recursively, maintaining the same page hierarchy in confluence. The application must maintain page versions and warn users when a sync will overwrite a more recent change."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to be able to synchronize my local markdown documentation with Confluence, so that I can easily keep my documentation up-to-date and accessible to my team.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a local directory of markdown files, **When** I run the `sync` command, **Then** the application should upload the files to Confluence, creating a page hierarchy that mirrors the local directory structure.
2. **Given** a Confluence page with attachments, **When** I run the `download` command, **Then** the application should download the page content and its attachments as a markdown file.
3. **Given** a markdown file with a mermaid diagram, **When** I run the `sync` command, **Then** the application should convert the mermaid diagram to an image and upload it as an attachment to the Confluence page.
4. **Given** that a Confluence page has been updated since the last sync, **When** I run the `sync` command, **Then** the application should warn me that I am about to overwrite a more recent version of the page.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user provides invalid Confluence credentials?
- How does the system handle a local file that is larger than the maximum attachment size in Confluence?
- What happens if the user tries to sync a directory that does not exist?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-003**: The system MUST allow users to upload markdown files to Confluence.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST convert markdown to Confluence page format.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST handle file attachments, including images.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST convert mermaid blocks into images and upload them as attachments.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST allow users to download pages from Confluence.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST convert Confluence pages to markdown format.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST be a command-line application.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST create a page hierarchy in Confluence that mirrors the local directory structure.
