# Session: Get Page Attachment URL Escape Fix
**Date**: 2025-09-29
**Duration**: ~0.5 hours
**Participants**: User, Gemini

## Objectives
- Fix a bug in the `get-page` command where image attachment URLs were being incorrectly escaped.

## Key Decisions
- The root cause was identified as double escaping of backslashes. The `preprocessConfluenceImages` function was adding a backslash to escape underscores, and then the `html-to-markdown` library was escaping that backslash again.
- The chosen solution was to remove the manual underscore escaping from the `preprocessConfluenceImages` function. This is the cleanest solution as underscores in URL paths do not need to be escaped, and `url.PathEscape` already handles other necessary URL encoding.

## Implementation Summary
Modified the `preprocessConfluenceImages` function in `cmd/conflux/commands/get_page.go` to remove the line that was escaping underscores in attachment URLs.

## Technical Details

### Modified Components
- `cmd/conflux/commands/get_page.go`: Removed incorrect underscore escaping logic.

### Files Modified/Created
- `cmd/conflux/commands/get_page.go` - Removed a `strings.ReplaceAll` call that was incorrectly escaping underscores.

## Tests Added
- No new tests were added as this was a small bug fix to existing code. The existing tests should still pass.

## Configuration Changes
None.

## Documentation Updates
None.

## Lessons Learned
- Be careful about double escaping, especially when chaining multiple processing steps (e.g., manual string replacement followed by a library call).
- Underscores are valid characters in URL paths and do not need to be escaped.

## Known Issues/TODOs
None.

## Next Steps
None.

## Related Commits
- (Pending) Commit fixing the attachment URL escaping.
