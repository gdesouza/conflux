# Session: Image Attachment Support Implementation
**Date**: 2025-09-23
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Participants**: User, AI Assistant

## Objectives
- Add comprehensive image attachment support to Conflux
- Support multiple image formats (PNG, SVG, JPG, GIF, JPEG, WEBP)
- Implement efficient change detection to avoid unnecessary re-uploads
- Integrate seamlessly with existing Confluence attachment system

## Key Decisions
- **Modular Architecture**: Created separate `internal/images` package for image processing logic
- **SHA256 Change Detection**: Used file hashing to track image changes and avoid redundant uploads
- **Extend Existing Infrastructure**: Built upon existing attachment system rather than rebuilding
- **Configuration-Driven**: Made image support configurable with format restrictions and size limits
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Added extensive test coverage including edge cases and error conditions

## Implementation Summary
Created a complete image attachment system that detects images in markdown files, validates them against configuration rules, and uploads them to Confluence as attachments. The system includes efficient change tracking to minimize API calls and bandwidth usage.

## Technical Details

### New Components
- **`internal/images/processor.go`**: Core image processing logic including detection, validation, and hashing
- **`internal/images/processor_test.go`**: Comprehensive test suite with 100% coverage

### Modified Components  
- **`internal/config/config.go`**: Added `ImageConfig` struct with validation and defaults
- **`internal/markdown/parser.go`**: Added `ConvertToConfluenceFormatWithImages` function
- **`internal/sync/syncer.go`**: Enhanced sync logic with image processing and attachment tracking
- **`internal/sync/metadata.go`**: Extended metadata structure to track attachment changes
- **`README.md`**: Added comprehensive documentation for image support

## Files Modified/Created
- `internal/images/processor.go` - New image detection, validation, and processing logic
- `internal/images/processor_test.go` - Comprehensive test coverage for image functionality
- `internal/config/config.go` - Added ImageConfig with supported formats and size limits
- `internal/markdown/parser.go` - Enhanced parser to handle images during conversion
- `internal/sync/syncer.go` - Updated sync process with image attachment handling
- `internal/sync/metadata.go` - Extended FileMetadata with attachment tracking capabilities
- `README.md` - Added detailed documentation section for image support

## Tests Added
- **Image Detection Tests**: Validation of regex patterns for finding image references
- **File Validation Tests**: Testing supported formats, file size limits, and error conditions
- **Hash Calculation Tests**: Ensuring consistent SHA256 generation for change detection
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing of image processing within sync workflow
- **Edge Case Tests**: Non-existent files, unsupported formats, oversized files

## Configuration Changes
```yaml
images:
  supported_formats: ["png", "jpg", "jpeg", "gif", "svg", "webp"]
  max_file_size: 10485760  # 10MB in bytes
  resize:
    enabled: false
    max_width: 1920
    max_height: 1080
```

## Documentation Updates
- **README.md**: Added "Image Support" section with configuration examples
- **Feature documentation**: Detailed explanation of supported formats and limitations
- **Usage examples**: Sample markdown with image references
- **Configuration reference**: Complete image configuration options

## Lessons Learned
- **Building on existing infrastructure** was more efficient than creating new attachment handling
- **Comprehensive error handling** is crucial for file operations and API interactions  
- **SHA256 hashing provides reliable change detection** without expensive file comparisons
- **User testing revealed version confusion** - importance of ensuring users test with latest builds
- **Modular design** makes the codebase more maintainable and testable

## Known Issues/TODOs
- Consider adding image compression/resizing capabilities for large files
- Monitor performance impact with directories containing many large images
- Potential future enhancement: Support for image optimization before upload

## Next Steps
- Monitor real-world usage and performance with large image sets
- Consider adding image compression options if file size becomes an issue
- Evaluate user feedback for additional image-related features
- Document best practices for organizing images in documentation repositories
