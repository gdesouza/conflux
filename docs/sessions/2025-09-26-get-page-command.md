# Session: Get Page Command Implementation
**Date**: 2025-09-26
**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Participants**: User, AI Assistant
**AI Model**: OpenAI-based coding assistant (context-aware session continuation)

## Objectives
- Add `pull` CLI command to retrieve Confluence page content
- Support multiple output formats: storage, html, markdown
- Reuse existing client while minimally extending data model
- Provide documentation and test coverage for new functionality

## Key Decisions
- **Format Flag (`-format`)**: Support explicit format selection with default of `storage` for backward-safe raw output.
- **View vs Storage Preference**: Prefer `body.view` HTML when available for `html` and `markdown` formats, fallback to `body.storage`.
- **Markdown Conversion Library**: Chose `github.com/JohannesKaufmann/html-to-markdown/v2` for robust HTML â†’ Markdown transformation instead of ad-hoc parsing.
- **Graceful Conversion Failure**: Fallback to returning raw HTML if markdown conversion errors to avoid hard failures.
- **ID or Title Resolution**: Attempt numeric ID lookup first (if input string is numeric), fallback to title search to avoid ambiguity.

## Implementation Summary
Implemented a new Cobra command `pull` that fetches a Confluence page either by ID or by title within a space, then outputs its content in one of three formats. Extended the Confluence client to expand `body.storage` and `body.view` for richer representation. Added focused tests around content selection and format handling.

## Technical Details

### New Components
- **`cmd/conflux/commands/get_page.go`**: Command definition, flag parsing, page retrieval logic, content formatting helper.

### Modified Components  
- **`internal/confluence/client.go`**: Added `Body.View.Value` field and expanded `GetPage` request to include `body.storage,body.view`.
- **`README.md`**: Added usage examples, command listing, flags, and dedicated section for `pull`.

## Files Modified/Created
- `cmd/conflux/commands/get_page.go` - New command implementation with format handling & output helper.
- `cmd/conflux/commands/get_page_test.go` - Tests for storage/html/markdown outputs and numeric detection.
- `internal/confluence/client.go` - Added view expansion for richer HTML retrieval.
- `README.md` - Documentation updates (command list, usage, flags, examples).
- `go.mod` / `go.sum` - Added html-to-markdown dependency and transitive requirements.
- `docs/sessions/2025-09-26-pull-command.md` - This session summary.

## Tests Added
- **Storage Output Test**: Validates raw storage retrieval.
- **HTML Preference Test**: Ensures view HTML is prioritized over storage.
- **HTML Fallback Test**: Confirms fallback to storage when view not present.
- **Markdown Conversion Tests**: Verifies both with and without `view` availability.
- **Unsupported Format Test**: Ensures error for invalid format.
- **Numeric Detection Test**: Validates heuristic used for ID vs title.

## Configuration Changes
No configuration schema changes were required for this feature.

## Documentation Updates
- README: Added new command section (examples, formats, flags) and listed command in CLI commands table.
- Session summary: This file documents rationale and implementation.

## Lessons Learned
- Leveraging `body.view` yields cleaner markdown conversions than storage XML-like content.
- Minimal client changes (adding `view`) provided significant downstream value without broad refactors.
- A small helper (`generatePageOutput`) improved testability and reduced command function complexity.

## Known Issues/TODOs
- `FindPageByTitle` currently only expands `body.storage`; could add `body.view` for parity.
- Markdown conversion may not perfectly round-trip Confluence-specific macros.
- `isNumeric` treats negative values as numeric; may refine if negative IDs are invalid.
- Potential enhancement: Add `--output` flag to write content to a file.

## Next Steps
- Add `body.view` expansion to `FindPageByTitle` for consistent HTML/markdown output.
- Introduce `--output <file>` flag to write retrieved content to disk.
- Add end-to-end command tests using a mock Confluence client interface.
- Implement macro normalization rules pre-markdown conversion (e.g., converting common Confluence macros to markdown hints or fenced blocks).
- Consider adding a `--select body.{storage|view}` low-level debug flag.
- Refine `isNumeric` to reject negatives if Confluence IDs are always positive.
- Add optional rate limiting or retry/backoff strategy for chained page fetches.
- Provide JSON output format (`--format json`) containing title, id, and all bodies for scripting.
- Evaluate caching layer for repeated `pull` calls in batch scripts.
- Extend title-based lookup to also request `body.view`.
- Add integration-style tests for end-to-end command execution with mock client interface.
- Evaluate adding macro normalization for improved markdown export fidelity.

- (Pending) Commit adding `pull` feature, tests, and docs.

## Notes
Markdown conversion intentionally avoids custom rule overrides for initial implementation simplicity; future sessions may refine rules to better handle Confluence macros or storage-specific elements.
